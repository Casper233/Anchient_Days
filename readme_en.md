## Before Start

This mod is the first minecraft mod I made which can work in 1.19.

There may be some bugs, so if you are comfortable to tell me the bugs, I'm always looking forward to your Issues.

## Background / Settings

Under the place where you live, there were a city. All of it's power combine into the debris.

The debris are now deeply under the soil.
